# PCSX2 XP - The PlayStation 2 Emulator

PCSX2 is a free and open-source PlayStation 2 (PS2) emulator. Its purpose is to emulate the PS2's hardware, using a combination of MIPS CPU [Interpreters](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)>), [Recompilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_recompilation) and a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) which manages hardware states and PS2 system memory. This allows you to play PS2 games on your PC, with many additional features and benefits.

As the original developers decided to remove Windows XP support back in 2016, we wanted to bring back compatibility with said operating system. Wasn't an easy task, but now XP users can finally enjoy from the latest version of this great emulator.
